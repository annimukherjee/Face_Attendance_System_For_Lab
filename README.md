# Face_Attendance_System_For_Lab

Majorly done by @akjalok and @swatimishra02 and @annimukherjee



This is a system which is used to take attendance at the lab using facial features and comparing it to the stored data of members. 

This helps us take the attendance easily and store it in the database.

## Working

### Step 1: Recognize a member

### Step 2: Log the member's intention and send data via API to lab's server

## Future Scope

Future scope is to improve the system's robustness and implement real time face recognition to input new familiar faces.
